    <p class="txt" id="about_txt"><b>What is CSS?</b>  <br>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Basically, it is a language that manages the design and presentation of web pages, that is, how they look when a user visits them. It works together with the HTML language that takes care of the basic content of the pages.
        They are called "cascading" style sheets because you can have multiple sheets and one of them with properties inherited (or "cascaded") from others.
        For many people a simple blog template is enough. Even so, when you want to customize the appearance of a site, you will need to implement CSS that, together with a good CMS, will help you enhance the reach of your content. <br> <br>
        <b>What is CSS for?</b>  <br>
        With CSS you can create rules to tell your website how you want to display information and keep commands for styling elements (such as fonts, colors, sizes, etc.) separate from those that set the content.
        Additionally, you can create specific formats useful for communicating your ideas and producing more visually pleasing experiences for website users.</p>
